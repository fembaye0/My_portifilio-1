            The Gateway experience emphasized the importance of a solid foundation in coding fundamentals. By focusing on HTML and CSS, I gained crucial skills for building effective and well-structured web pages. This focus on core technologies has strengthened my ability to solve technical problems and create robust solutions.

                In the personal realm, I gained valuable insights into enhancing my brand and soft skills. I learned effective time management techniques that improve productivity and balance. The program also taught me how to advocate for myself in the workplace, discuss transferable skills using the STAR method in job interviews, and present confidently. These skills are crucial for making a strong impression and navigating professional environmentsÂ successfully.
